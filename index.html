            <h1>Introduction</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Burmese pythons are amazing reptiles whose massive size and power are often married to a surprisingly gentle disposition. While they can be environmentally harmful when introduced outside their native habitats, their history in captivity proves them as invaluable ambassadors for reptile education and conservation! The key to success in keeping a giant reptile is, as in many things, education and responsibility. Here's a few cool things to know about these giant danger noodles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Burmese pythons are one of the largest reptiles in the world, and can grow to be well over 15 feet in length and weigh more than 200lbs! </li>
            <li>Despite snakes being ectothermic (meaning their body heat comes from external sources), Burmese pythons are one of the only snake parents who use vibrational friction to generate heat to keep their eggs warm!</li>
            <li>Burmese python eyes have a narrow, vertical pupil much like a cat. It's a common misconception that this is indicative of a venomous snake, but that is not the case. Instead, the pupil shape tells us what time of day or night the animal is most active! The vertical pupil of the Burmese python help it to see well in the night, which is one of their most productive times.</li>
            <li>They are one of the most gentle species of snake, hence their popularity as reptile ambassadors and zoo animals. </li>
            <li>Despite their size and incredible strength, Burmese pythons (like all snakes) have no desire to harm or fight with humans. They will bite for only two reasons: to defend themselves, or because they have mistaken you for food!</li>
          </ul>

          <h1>Heating</h1>
        </header>
          <code>Hot Side Around 90째F, Cool Side Around 80째F</code>
          <p>Since Burmese pythons are cold blooded, provding adequate heat is crucial for their health and digestion. Maintain a warm side (around 90째F) and a cool side (around 80째F), so that your snake can thermoregulate and always find a comfortable spot. For a young snake (or any which uses hides) make sure there are hides on both sides. </p>

      <section id="Feeding" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h1>Feeding</h1>
        </header>
          <code>Food Item Thickness = Snake Thickness at Thickest point</code>
          <p>Food should be pre-killed whenever possible, and be roughly the size of the thickest part of your snakes body. As babies they can be fed once every 7-10 days, but it's important to not overfeed as they mature. An over-fed Burmese python will grow too quickly and become obese, which causes health problems and shortens their life span. When feeding adults, it's okay to let a couple weeks go by between meals sometimes if your pet is getting too chunky! This way, their body is not in a constant state of digestion. </p>
          <p>Keep in mind that it's best not to handle your snake for about 48 hours (to be on the safe side) after a meal as it can be uncomfortable for them and may even cause regurgitation. </p>
          <p>It's also ideal to provide fresh purified water for your snake to drink and if possible soak in as desired. Water usually needs to be changed at least once a week.</p>

          <h1>Housing</h1>
        </header>
          <code>MINIMUM: Snake Length = Enclodure Width + Enclosure Depth</code>
          <p>Provide a large enough enclosure for your snake to be able to fully stretch out if possible, or at least to be no longer than the width plus one end of their enclosure. An adult Burmese python could potentially require an 8' x 4' enclosure or larger. Keep in mind also that females grow larger and heavier than males! Be sure to do a thorough cleaning at least once a month, while spot cleaning as needed. </p>

          <h1>Handling and Safety</h1>
        </header>
          <p>Burmese pythons are usually awesome snakes to handle. Their huge size and laid back attitudes make them incredible to interact with! As is the case with many snakes, if you support their weight and are gentle with them they will likely be gentle with you. Mine is often happy to just lay on my lap. Babies and youngsters may be defensive, but gentle and consistent time with them will be rewarded. While Burmese pythons are often one of the easiest giant snakes to handle, we always have to remember that large constrictors are incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous in the wrong circumstances.</p>
         <p>Get to know your individual very well. Recognize any changes in their behavior. When you are educated and attentive, surprises are much less likely to happen! When opening your pythons enclosure, always assume that it is hungry and hoping you bring food. Watch for jerky, and possibly faster than usual movements that seem intensely focused. It is always a good idea to tap your snake or move it gentley with a snake hook or similar item to let him or her know that this isn't feeding time!</p>
         <code>Moutwash/Hand Sanitizer = Release Bite</code>
         <p>
         <code>Pinch/Nibble End of Tail = Stop Constriction</code>
         <p>If you are mistaken for food, your snake may strike and latch on tight while looping coils around whatever part of you it can. Rather than releasing you and realizing it's mistake, your snake may seem "stuck" biting into you and squeezing, as if it doesn't know how to stop. If you have a large adult, you should never be feeding or handling it alone. If you do end up in this position, do not fight the snake or try to pry it's mouth off of you. Instead, you have a few tried and true options to minimize harm to you or your confused pet! You or your handling partner can pour mouthwash or hand sanitizer on the mouth of the snake to snap them out of feeding mode. To quickly stop constriction, you can nibble or pinch the end of the snakes tail! </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        </header>
          <p>While females are capable of exceeding 15 feet in length, Burmese pythons are actually one of the easier giant snakes to care for. Defensive behaviors in snakes come from fear, and a snake the size of a tree trunk often has less of that!</p>
        
          <p>With that being said, this is only a pet for a responsible and capable adult or family. They should never be left alone with children, other pets, or anything that they could accidentally harm or which could harm them. And again, you should never handle a large adult Burmese python alone. Never underestimate the strength of a giant snake. But if you do have the resources and just as importantly the education, they are fascinating and rewarding animals who may be with you for decades!</p>
